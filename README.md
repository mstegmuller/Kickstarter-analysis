preforming analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

Written analysis for Kickstarter

The Purpose of the project was to create Charts to help Louise find out the best times to do a kickstarter campaign and to figure out different campaigns fared in comparison to their launch date and funding goal.  

Analysis and Challenges

To perform the analysis for the launch date and goal. I had to create two charts.  First was a pivot chart to show theater outcomes by launch date.  I had to filter the pivot table by years and parent company.  The chart showed the number of successful, failed and cancelled outcomes by month.  I had to use the year function to create the table.  By doing this you can filter the table my month and year.  I had difficulties figuring out how to find the reverse alphabetical order for the rows and I had to use google.
For the outcomes based on goals we had to make a line chart for the theater kick starters outcomes based on goals for amount pledged.  This was more difficult as you had to be precise with the formulas.  First we had to create a column for the goals of the kick starters and input the amount pledged in increments of about 5000.  Then we had to use the countifs function to get information from the kick starter page to the outcomes page.  I had difficulty inputting the formula and had to use google to understand what I needed to do better.  I noticed I had to be more accurate with how I was inputting my formulas.  Once I figured this out I was able to use the sum function for the total projects and was able find the percentages.      

Results

Two conclusions I can draw about the theatre outcomes by Launch date are as follows.  First that theatre kick starters that are launched in the warmer months, April, May, June, July, and August are more frequent and more successful.  The second thing I can conclude is that slightly more than half the kick starters fail.  However, if it is started in the warmer months they will have more of a chance to succeed.  
In the outcomes based on goals I can conclude that if a kick starter had a goal of more than $25000 the higher chance it had to be successful.  

Some limitations of the data set are it doesnâ€™t show the average number of donations or how much each doner donated to a kick starter campaign.  By knowing this you could have a better understanding of how many donations are needed to be successful and how much.  Would it be better getting a large donation from one entity or many donations from multiple entities?    

Some other types of tables we could have used for the data set could have been a pie chart to show what type of kick starters were the most successful or which type of kick starter had the most amount pledged.
